This has been a three‐year journey begun in 2021 (the research has taken longer, nearly six years). But now I have "completed" the Templars Modpack. I say completed but what I really been is “good enough” for release and community critique.

The Order of the Knights Templar, founded after the First Crusade to the Levant, has been shrouded by mystery and intrigue. They appear in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (Spielberg, 2014), National Treasure (Turteltaub J. , 2011), The Da Vinci Code (John Calley, 2009), Kingdom of Heaven (Ridley Scott, 2014), Arn the Knights Templar (Flinth, 2016), Season of the Witch (Alex Gartner C. R., 2011), Ironclad (English, 2011), and Knight Fall (Various, 2018) – to name a few.


They are written about in The Last Templar (Reilly & Chaykin, 2006), Brethren (Young, 2007), Holy Blood Holy Grail (Baigent, Leigh, & Lincoln, 1983), The Templar Legacy (Berry, 2006), The Da Vinci Code (Brown, 2003), The Trial of the Templars (Barber, The Trial of the Templars, 2012), and my own book The Knights of the Cross (Strickland, 2011) – to name a few.

They were distinguished by sight for their long textile garment worn over their chainmail armor that was known as a surcoat. They bore an arming sword that was double‐edged and broad‐shaped with a rounded point. It was about 38 inches long and intended for slashing and cutting rather than thrusting. It had a simple cross‐guard and pommel. They were well suited for hand‐to‐hand combat and effective against the mail armor of the period. The popular Great sword (longsword) of film did not appear until after 1250 A.D.

The main purpose of this book is to demonstrate how to build a scenario, in general, as well as to a specific scenario for Freeciv. Every scenario for multiplayer games, simulations, operational tests, and so on, have certain properties or components:

1. Some realism, like a historical setting
2. A map for the scenario to be acted out
3. Terrain types, like hills forests, swamp, and so on.
4. Resources like oil, aluminum, wheat, fruit, and so on.
5. Nations, cities, roads, mines, fields, farms, and so on.
6. Units, like engineers, infantry, tanks, ships, and so on.
7. Government or ideology, like fundamentalism and despotism, and so on.
8. Technological advances, like iron working, advanced archery, and so on.
9. Buildings, like houses, fortresses, barracks, markets, and so on.
10. Rules and effects, like how battlefield medicine affects unit health, and so on.
So, as we walk through scenario construction for Freeciv, we should keep the main purpose in mind: Scenario Design and Construction.
