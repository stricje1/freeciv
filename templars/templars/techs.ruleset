In the 6th century, John Philoponus partly accepted Aristotle's theory\ 
that 'continuation of motion depends on continued action of a force,'\ 
but modified it to include his idea that the hurled body acquires a\
 motive power or inclination for forced movement from the agent\
 producing the initial motion and that this power secures the\ 
 continuation of such motion. However, he argued that this impresse\
 virtue was temporay: that it was a self-expending inclination, and\
 thus the violent motion produced comes to an end, changing back into\
 natural motion. In the 11th century, Avicenna (Ibn Sīnā) discussed\
 Philoponus' theory in The Book of Healing, in Physics IV.14 he says:\
 When we independently verify the issue (of projectile motion), we\
 find the most correct doctrine is the doctrine of those who think\
 that the moved object acquires an inclination from the mover. Ibn\
 Sīnā agreed that an impetus is imparted to a projectile by the\
 thrower, but unlike Philoponus, who believed that it was a temporary\
 virtue that would decline even in a vacuum, he viewed it as persistent,\
 requiring external forces such as air resistance to dissipate.\

 the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem, the Great Mosque in Damascus, the\
 second Great Mosques in Kufa and Basra and the desert palaces of the\
 Umayyads – to name only some of the more notable buildings. Once\
 established, the tradition for fine architecture continued to\
 flourish in Islam, as witnessed, for example, by al-Mansur’s Baghdad,\
 the works of Ibn Tulun in Egypt, the Great Mosque of Cordoba and the\
 Alhambra palace in Granada, the complex of splendid buildings in\
 Isfahan and so on. Many well-illustrated books have been devoted to\

The main determinant of the Muslim tactics during the crusades was the\

 cavalry, the horse archers that made up the bulk of the Islamic armies\
 were highly mobile. This mobility was used in four ways which gave the\
 Turks an advantage over the European armies which could be highly\
 dangerous when they approached for close combat. High mobility allowed\
 the Islamic army to maintain a distance from the enemy and choose the\
 moment at which they would close with them. This allowed for the Muslim\
 forces to generally control the place and timing of the major\
 confrontations. The second use of this mobility was the feigned retreat\
 which allowed them to lead the Europeans into ambushes or to cause a\
 fake retreat to last for some days to tire the enemy. Good mobility\
 allowed them to attack the weakest points in the enemy's army. The rear\
 and the flanks made ideal targets against the Europeans since the\
 commander would travel in the vanguard at the front of the column while\
 traveling. This caused chaos while traveling, and in a battle it allowed\
 the Turks to attack the crusaders without ever coming into a pitched\
 battle with the main body of the Europeans until they were worn-down and\
 had lost all support from the flanks of the attack in battle. The last\
