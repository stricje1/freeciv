; Modifying this file:
; You should not modify this file except to make bugfixes or
; for other "maintenance".  If you want to make custom changes,
; you should create a new datadir subdirectory and copy this file
; into that directory, and then modify that copy.  Then use the
; command "rulesetdir <mysubdir>" in the server to have freeciv
; use your new customized file.
;
; You should sort role units from worst to better, as often the best
; available role unit of a given sort will be picked by choosing
; the first available (not obsolete) such unit, or by picking the last
; such unit directly. When determining starting units, the first 
; unit with the relevant role that the player can build will be chosen.
; If no such unit can be found (eg Explorers that require Seafaring),
; then the first unit with this role will be chosen.

A knight is a person granted an honorary title of knighthood\
 by a head of state (including the pope) or representative for\
 service to the monarch, the church or the country, especially\

 hippeis and hoplite (ἱππεῖς) and Roman eques and centurion of\
 classical antiquity. In the Early Middle Ages in Europe,\
 knighthood was conferred upon mounted warriors. During the\
 High Middle Ages, knighthood was considered a class of lower\
 nobility. By the Late Middle Ages, the rank had become\
 associated with the ideals of chivalry, a code of conduct for\
 the perfect courtly Christian warrior. Often, a knight was a\
 vassal who served as an elite fighter, a bodyguard or a\
 mercenary for a lord, with payment in the form of land holdings.\

 to act as bodyguards for the emperors and other important nobles.\
 They were divided into two groups: the day guard (Torguud) and\
 the night guard (Khevtuul). They were distinct from the regular\
 army and would not go to battle with them, instead staying back\
 on guard duty. Their supreme commander was called the Cherbi.\

 hippeis and hoplite (ἱππεῖς) and Roman eques and centurion of\
 classical antiquity. In the Early Middle Ages in Europe,\
 knighthood was conferred upon mounted warriors. During the\
 High Middle Ages, knighthood was considered a class of lower\
 nobility. By the Late Middle Ages, the rank had become\
 associated with the ideals of chivalry, a code of conduct for\
 the perfect courtly Christian warrior. Often, a knight was a\

 service to the monarch, the church or the country, especially\
 in a military capacity. Knighthood finds origins in the Greek\
 hippeis and hoplite (ἱππεῖς) and Roman eques and centurion of\
 classical antiquity. In the Early Middle Ages in Europe,\
 knighthood was conferred upon mounted warriors. During the\
 High Middle Ages, knighthood was considered a class of lower\
 nobility. By the Late Middle Ages, the rank had become\
 associated with the ideals of chivalry, a code of conduct for\
 the perfect courtly Christian warrior. Often, a knight was a\
 vassal who served as an elite fighter, a bodyguard or a\
 mercenary for a lord, with payment in the form of land holdings.\
