Ecclesiastical or sacerdotal-monarchical state (a type of theocracy)\
 ruled by the pope who is the bishop of Rome and head of the Catholic\
 Church. The highest state functionaries are all Catholic clergy of\
 various national origins. After the Avignon Papacy (1309â€“1437), the\
 popes have mainly resided at the Apostolic Palace within what is now\
 Vatican City, although at times residing instead in the Quirinal\
 Palace in Rome or elsewhere.
