 such as the arrière-ban in France. Like a darfet board, Arrière-ban denoted\
 a general levy, where all able-bodied males living in France were summoned\

 around the top were dragon's heads holding bronze balls. When\
 there was an earthquake, one of the dragons' mouths would open\
 and drop its ball into a bronze toad at the base, making a sound\
 and supposedly showing the direction of the earthquake. On at\
 least one occasion, probably at the time of a large earthquake\
 in Gansu in AD 143, the seismoscope indicated an earthquake even\
 though one was not felt. The first earthquake recorded by this\
 seismoscope was supposedly 'somewhere in the east'. Days later,\
 a rider from the east reported this earthquake.

The monastic hospitaler order was founded following the First Crusade by\

 the original hospice was expanded to an infirmary[3] near the Church of the\
 Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem. Initially the group cared for pilgrims in\
 Jerusalem, but the order soon extended to providing pilgrims with an armed\
 escort, which soon grew into a substantial force. Thus the Order of St. John\

 the Crusades, the Hospitallers s used a plain Latin cross. Occasional use of\
 the modern form straight-edged 'eight-pointed cross' by the order begins in\
 the early 16th century. This early form is a cross moline (ancrée) or cross\
 branchée ending in eight points, not yet featuring the sharp vertex of the\

 were confined to the County of Tripoli and, when Acre was captured in 1291, the\
